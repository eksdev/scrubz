      <p>Welcome Scrubz!</p>

<p>Hey guys! I finally got my website up and running! I hope to be posting videos and behind the scenes vlogs all on this page that you are on right now. I am so psyched to finally have my own youtube channel. If you support the Scrubz and want to become part of the Scrubz Army, all you have to do is email us at <a href="mailto:scrubzarmy@gmail.com">scrubzarmy@gmail.com</a> for information on how you can become an official scrub. If you haven't already subscribed to MicroFoote and Archuloes, make sure to do that right after you subscribe to us. Thanks for all the support and I can't wait to start posting more for all you guys! </p>
