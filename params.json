I am so psyched to finally have my own youtube channel. If you support the Scrubz and want to become part of the Scrubz Army, all you have to do is email us at scrubzarmy@gmail.com for information on how you can become an official scrub. If you haven't already subscribed to MicroFoote and Archuloes, make sure to do that right after you subscribe to us. Thanks for all the support and I can't wait to start posting more for all you guys.\r\n\r\nMake sure to follow me on Instagram! @sakonnetkid for lot's of selfies and other stuff. As you might know, I take every fan's comments so if you have any ideas for a new episode you can email us at scrubzarmy@gmail.com or comment on any of my videos. If you have any suggestions regarding our name (Scrubz Army), we would be more than happy to change our name if improved upon. If you guys send any merchandise over here to where the magic happens we will give you a big shout out from the me and the rest of the team with a custom unboxing video for you guys! \r\n\r\nIm still learning how to code, but if you have any ideas for the site I would be more than happy to change our layout or anything that bugs you about the website, (unless it's something too personal). \r\n\r\nIf you do not like our videos please don't watch our videos because we only want a friendly feed on our channel. I saw that my first video got a lot of hate, let's try to refrain from that happening again. \r\n\r\nThank you guys for visiting the site, make sure to hit those like buttons and [SCRUBZSCRIBE] to our channel. Thanks, and bye!\r\n<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe3GVq_c6imDwshcQyZCesg>\r\n",
